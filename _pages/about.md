I'm a fourth-year Ph.D candidate from [Center for Brain-inspired Computing Research](https://www.cbicr.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. My research interests include dataflow architecture, brain-inspired computing, and parallel computing.

I am advised by Prof. Rong Zhao and Prof. Luping Shi now. I was advised by Prof. Rui Chang from Zhejiang University when I was an undergraduate student.
